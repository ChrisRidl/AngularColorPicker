# Exercise

For this excercise you will be writing your own color picker component! 
You are free to build this component any way you'd like. I have included
an Angular 12 starting application along with a template to get you started. Under the `services` folder you will find
a service called `ColorService` in the `color.service.ts file`. This service will
return an observable of `Colors` you can use to populate your color picker.

Here is an example of what you're looking to build. 

![example](./src/assets/example.png)

## Requirements:
- Build a component that shows the current selected color, color name, and the color value (default to Black)
- When the color is clicked, a color selector appears displaying the colors from the `ColorService`
- Highlight the currently selected color in the color selector when it is opened
- When a color is selected, the color selector closes and the main component updates with the selected color

Styling is completely up to you. I encourage you to be creative! However, functionality is more important ðŸ˜‰

Good luck!

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
